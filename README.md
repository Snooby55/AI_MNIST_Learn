# AI_MNIST_Learn
Here are two files, in one "LearnModel.py" we train our model on the MNIST dataset with handwritten images of numbers 0 to 9. In this file, you can also change the number of layers as needed. In another file "CheckModel.py", we will check our trained model. After starting, a window will appear in which you can draw and our model will immediately make predictions.

LMB - draw;
RMB - erase;
q - exit/end the process
